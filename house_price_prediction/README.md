# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of the internship at **Codec Intern**. It aims to develop a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on features such as the number of rooms, location, size (square feet), and other relevant factors.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Build a machine learning model to predict the price of houses using regression techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing features like:

- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Area in square feet
- Location
- Year built
- Other relevant parameters

## 🧪 Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/praneethreddyganta/Codex-Intern.git
   cd Codex-Intern/Project1
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required libraries**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Open `LinearRegressionModel.ipynb` and follow the code to train the model**
