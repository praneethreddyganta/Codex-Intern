House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using a linear regression model. The project involves collecting a dataset from Kaggle, performing extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing the data, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance. The primary goal is to build a model that can make accurate price predictions on unseen data.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle. It contains various features of houses that are relevant for predicting their market price.

Dataset: [Link to your Kaggle Dataset]

Key Features: number_of_rooms, location, size_sqft, age_of_house, etc. (You should update this list with the actual columns from your dataset).

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You can then install the required libraries using pip. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required packages
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyterlab

Project Workflow
The project follows a standard data science workflow:

Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from a .csv file into a pandas DataFrame.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.

Converting categorical features to numerical format.

Checking for and handling outliers.

Feature scaling to normalize the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to uncover patterns using statistical summaries and visualizations.

Model Training:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Training a LinearRegression model on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R-squared (R²).

Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions.

Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualizations
Visualizations are crucial for understanding the data's underlying structure.

1. Scatter Plot: Size vs. Price
(Insert your scatter plot image here or describe the findings)
Observation: There is a clear positive correlation between the size of the house and its price.

2. Bar Chart: Average Price by Location
(Insert your bar chart image here or describe the findings)
Observation: Location is a significant price driver, with some areas having much higher average prices.

3. Heatmap: Feature Correlation
(Insert your heatmap image here or describe the findings)
Observation: The heatmap reveals strong positive correlations between price and features like size_sqft and number_of_rooms.

Model Training & Evaluation
Model: Linear Regression (sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression)

Evaluation Metrics: MAE, MSE, R-squared (R²)

Results:

R² Score: [Enter your R² score here, e.g., 0.85]

MAE: [Enter your MAE value here]

MSE: [Enter your MSE value here]

Observations & Insights
The most influential factors in determining house price were found to be size (square footage) and location.

The linear regression model was able to explain [Your R² Score as a percentage, e.g., 85%] of the variance in house prices.

The model's predictions are, on average, off by [Your MAE value] from the actual price.
