# Advanced House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 1. Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive, step-by-step methodology for predicting house prices using the Ames Housing dataset from Kaggle. The primary objective is to develop a robust linear regression model through rigorous data preprocessing, insightful exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creative feature engineering. The project also explores advanced regularization techniques (Ridge and Lasso) to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.

This repository serves as a demonstration of a complete data science workflow, from initial data exploration to final model evaluation and interpretation.
