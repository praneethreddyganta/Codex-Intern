Advanced House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
1. Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive, step-by-step methodology for predicting house prices using the Ames Housing dataset from Kaggle. The primary objective is to develop a robust linear regression model by performing rigorous data preprocessing, insightful exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creative feature engineering. The project also explores advanced regularization techniques (Ridge and Lasso) to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.

This repository serves as a demonstration of a complete data science workflow, from initial data exploration to final model evaluation and interpretation.

4. Technologies Used
This project leverages several key Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning:

Python 3.8+

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation, preprocessing, and evaluation.

JupyterLab: For interactive development and analysis.

5. Installation
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# 3. Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file listing the libraries mentioned above).

6. Project Workflow
The project follows a systematic data science workflow designed to ensure reproducibility and robustness.

Data Loading: Load the raw train.csv and test.csv files.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values strategically and addressing outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the target variable (SalePrice) and explore relationships between features.

Feature Engineering: Create new, high-impact features from existing ones to improve model accuracy.

Modeling: Train and evaluate a baseline Linear Regression model, followed by advanced Ridge (L2) and Lasso (L1) regularized models.

Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like R-squared (R²) and Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).

7. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values
A key challenge in the Ames dataset is the presence of missing data. A nuanced strategy was employed, recognizing that NA often signifies the absence of a feature (e.g., no pool) rather than a truly missing value.

Categorical Features: NA was replaced with a 'None' string for features like PoolQC, Alley, Fence, FireplaceQu, and garage/basement-related columns.

Numerical Features: Missing LotFrontage was imputed with the median value grouped by Neighborhood to maintain local data characteristics.

Outlier Detection
Outliers were identified via scatter plots (e.g., GrLivArea vs. SalePrice). A conservative approach was taken, removing only a few egregious data points that clearly deviated from the general trend to avoid compromising the model's ability to generalize.

Target Variable Transformation
The target variable, SalePrice, was found to be highly right-skewed. A logarithmic transformation (np.log1p) was applied to normalize its distribution. This is critical for satisfying the assumptions of linear regression and aligns the model with the competition's RMSLE evaluation metric.

8. Feature Engineering
This was a critical phase for boosting model performance. New features were created to capture complex relationships:

TotalSF: Sum of total basement, 1st floor, and 2nd floor square footage.

TotalBath: A weighted sum of all full and half bathrooms.

HouseAge: The age of the house at the time of sale (YrSold - YearBuilt).

Qual_SF: An interaction term between overall quality and total square footage (OverallQual * TotalSF).

Categorical features were encoded using One-Hot Encoding for nominal variables and Label Encoding for ordinal variables.

9. Modeling & Evaluation
Models
Three linear models were trained and compared:

Baseline Linear Regression (OLS): An initial model to establish a performance benchmark.

Ridge Regression (L2): A regularized model used to handle multicollinearity and prevent overfitting by shrinking coefficient values.

Lasso Regression (L1): A regularized model that performs automatic feature selection by shrinking irrelevant feature coefficients to zero.

Evaluation
Models were evaluated on a held-out test set (20% of the data).

Primary Metric: Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE), as required by the Kaggle competition.

Secondary Metrics: R-squared (R²), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

The Lasso Regression model was selected as the final model due to its superior performance and its ability to create a more parsimonious model through automatic feature selection.

10. How to Use
Ensure all dependencies from requirements.txt are installed.

Place the Kaggle dataset (train.csv, test.csv) in the data/raw/ directory.

Run the Jupyter Notebook notebooks/01_data_exploration_and_modeling.ipynb to execute the entire workflow from data loading to model evaluation.

The final, trained Lasso model is saved in the models/ directory.
